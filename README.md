Mining optimization program,rewrite from [https://github.com/MatthewVD/ultpit](https://github.com/MatthewVD/ultpit).

It can run in 3 modes:

1. 


* opt.exe is the executable files compile for 32 bits Windows.
* I have tested it with the 5 test datas in test directory,the test all passed.
* The are a run.jpg file in test\bauxite_46800,which shows how to run the program and verify the result.

# How to test

* cd one test directory,such as test\bauxite_46800
* run command:   ..\..\Go\opt.exe -i data.txt.gz -o out.log -- params.json
* unzip the expected.txt.gz,which contains expected.txt
* compare out.log with expected.txt to see whether they are same: comp out.log expected.txt

# About Go sources

The Go sources in cmd and optimization directory.

* Godeps and vendor directory containes the 3rd source the program depends.It is copyed to there b github.com/tools/godep.
* Files in cmd directory is for command line parse.It is generated by github.com/spf13/cobra.
* Files in optimization directory is main source of operation.
  * It use Go strandard library for json parsing and gzip file operation.
  * It implements the LERCHSGROSSMANN algorithm.
  * It implements DIMACSPROGRAM algorithm,which just call a external program to do the work.
  * It omits all test code.
